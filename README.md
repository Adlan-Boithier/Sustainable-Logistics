# Sustainable-Logistics
This project enhances tourism in Switzerland by improving affordability, environmental sustainability, and travel efficiency. It addresses the challenge of high living costs through optimized, cost-effective, and eco-friendly travel plans using advanced algorithms, making the country more accessible to tourists.

## **Problematic Issues Addressed:**
- Developed a comprehensive strategy for improving tourism in Switzerland, considering tourist affordability, environmental sustainability, and travel efficiency.
- Applied the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and packing problem algorithms to overcome the high cost of living challenge for tourists by creating optimized, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly travel plans.
- The TSP algorithm helped find the most efficient route based on distance, time, and cost.
- The variant of the knapsack algorithm allows tourists to customize their travel plans based on their travel time and budget.

## **Findings:**
- The results highlight the potential underutilization of the Swiss rail system by tourists, mainly due to high costs.
- The pricing policy needs to be revised to make it more attractive and affordable for tourists.
- Lower train prices can attract more tourists and promote a way of travel that is not only economical but also environmentally friendly.

## **Recommandations for SBB/CFF/FFS:**
- Creation of a reduced fare card for adults, reserved for tourists (whether daily, weekly, ...)
- If such a card does not meet the company's financial objectives, approach the government, which is constantly acting against pollution, to obtain help in creating this process.

## **Recommandations for tourists:**
- For short stays, renting a car remains the cheapest and most convenient option (faster than the train). But don't forget the ecological aspect and reduce your travel time/distance as much as possible.
- Travelling by train can be more expensive but is still affordable for families with young children (-16 years) who pay only 19 CHF per day for train travel. In addition, tourists will enjoy the additional scenery and comfort of Swiss trains while doing something for the environment and emitting much less CO2 than if they were to travel by car, thus helping to protect the environment.
Depending on the number of passengers, a train can be up to 10 times more ecological than a car for the same distance travelled.
- A route creation tool may be implemented for tourists in order to optimize their trip in the any way wanted.
