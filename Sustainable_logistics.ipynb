        "We decided to work on tourism in Switzerland. Switzerland being a relatively expensive country for a foreigner due to the high standard of living here, it seems important to us to be able to propose solutions to visit this magnificent country at a lower cost. The problems of travel time and distance traveled are also to be considered insofar as traveling while taking care of one's footprint on the environment is important in view of the current climate situation but also to preserve the Swiss environment which is still very well preserved compared to other countries. In order to optimize this, we have designed different algorithms seen during Sustainable Logistics to allow travelers to visit Switzerland at a lower cost but also to reduce their impact on the climate.\n",
